# Vervet - A mongo database explorer

![Vervet Logo](./art/logo.svg "Vervet Logo")

Vervet is a desktop application designed for querying and managing MongoDB
databases, built with a modern and responsive user interface. It is
developed using the Wails framework, combining the power of Go for the backend
with the flexibility of Vue.js and the Quasar component library for the frontend.

It is currently still in development, with many feature missing.
